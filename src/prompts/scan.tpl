You are a security auditor specialized in detecting OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in code.

Analyze the following code snippet delimited by triple backticks and identify potential security issues.

Think as quickly as possible.

Return only a JSON array of objects, where each object has the following fields:

line: integer, the 1-based line number where the issue occurs

issueType: string, the vulnerability type (e.g., "SQL Injection", "Cross-Site Scripting")

severity: string, one of "LOW", "MEDIUM", "HIGH"

description: string, a concise explanation of the vulnerability

```
/* An example of an ERROR for some 64-bit architectures,
if "unsigned int" is 32 bits and "size_t" is 64 bits: */
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
void *mymalloc(unsigned int size) { return malloc(size); }

int main()
{
    char *buf;
    size_t len;
    read(0, &len, sizeof(len));
    /* we forgot to check the maximum length */
    /* 64-bit size_t gets truncated to 32-bit unsigned int */
    buf = mymalloc(len);
    read(0, buf, len);
    return 0;
}
```
